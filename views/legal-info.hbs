<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
 
<h4 id="scope-of-BorregoRentals-services"><a name="sec1"></a> 1. Scope of BorregoRentals Services</h4>
 
<p>1.1 The BorregoRentals Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“<strong>Members</strong>”) and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “<strong>Hosts</strong>” and the services they offer are “<strong>Host Services</strong>”) to publish such Host Services on the BorregoRentals Platform (“<strong>Listings</strong>”) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Host Services (Members using Host Services are “<strong>Guests</strong>”). Host Services may include the offering of vacation or other properties for use ("<strong>Accommodations</strong>"), single or multi-day activities in various categories (“<strong>Experiences</strong>”), access to unique events and locations (“<strong>Events</strong>”), and a variety of other travel and non-travel related services.</p>
 
<p>1.2 As the provider of the BorregoRentals Platform, BorregoRentals does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. BorregoRentals is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is BorregoRentals a real estate broker or insurer. BorregoRentals is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>
 
<p>1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, BorregoRentals has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. BorregoRentals does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by BorregoRentals about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by BorregoRentals of any Host or Listing.</p>
 
<p>1.4 If you choose to use the BorregoRentals Platform as a Host or Co-Host (as defined below), your relationship with BorregoRentals is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of BorregoRentals for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of BorregoRentals.</p>
 
<p>1.5 To promote the BorregoRentals Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages. BorregoRentals cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The BorregoRentals Platform may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.</p>
 
<p>1.6 The BorregoRentals Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. BorregoRentals is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by BorregoRentals of such Third-Party Services.</p>
 
<p>1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, BorregoRentals cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the BorregoRentals Platform. BorregoRentals may restrict the availability of the BorregoRentals Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the BorregoRentals Platform. BorregoRentals may improve, enhance and modify the BorregoRentals Platform and introduce new BorregoRentals Services from time to time.</p>

<p>2.2 You will comply with any applicable export control laws in your local jurisdiction.

<p>2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).</p>
 
<p>2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the BorregoRentals Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the BorregoRentals Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.</p>
 
<p>2.6 If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store, you agree to <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/">Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement</a>.

Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="modification-of-these-terms"><a name="sec3"></a> 3. Modification of these Terms</h4>
 
<p>BorregoRentals reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the BorregoRentals Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the BorregoRentals Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
 
<h4 id="account-registration"><a name="sec4"></a> 4. Account Registration</h4>
 
<p>4.1 You must register an account ("<strong>BorregoRentals Account</strong>") to access and use certain features of the BorregoRentals Platform, such as publishing or booking a Listing. If you are registering an BorregoRentals Account for a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to legally bind that entity and grant us all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms.</p>
 
<p>4.2 You can register an BorregoRentals Account using an email address and creating a password, or through your account with certain third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Google ("<strong>SNS Account</strong>"). You have the ability to disable the connection between your BorregoRentals Account and your SNS Account at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the BorregoRentals Platform.</p>
 
<p>4.3 You must provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and keep your BorregoRentals Account and public BorregoRentals Account profile page information up-to-date at all times.</p>
 
<p>4.4 You may not register more than one (1) BorregoRentals Account unless BorregoRentals authorizes you to do so. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your BorregoRentals Account to another party.</p>
 
<p>4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your BorregoRentals Account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately notify BorregoRentals if you know or have any reason to suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your BorregoRentals Account. You are liable for any and all activities conducted through your BorregoRentals Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).</p>
 
<p>4.6 BorregoRentals may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions that affect your BorregoRentals Account. For example, we may allow Members associated with an Enterprise (as defined in our Privacy Policy) to book for other Members, or we may allow Hosts to add other Members as Co-Hosts (as defined below) to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No third party is authorized by BorregoRentals to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another Member.</p>
 
<h4 id="content"><a name="sec5"></a> 5. Content</h4>
 
<p>5.1 BorregoRentals may, at its sole discretion, enable Members to (i) create, upload, post, send, receive and store content, such as text, photos, audio, video, or other materials and information on or through the BorregoRentals Platform ("<strong>Member Content</strong>"); and (ii) access and view Member Content and any content that BorregoRentals itself makes available on or through the BorregoRentals Platform, including proprietary BorregoRentals content and any content licensed or authorized for use by or through BorregoRentals from a third party ("<strong>BorregoRentals Content</strong>" and together with Member Content, "<strong>Collective Content</strong>").</p>
 
<p>5.2 The BorregoRentals Platform, BorregoRentals Content, and Member Content may in its entirety or in part be protected by copyright, trademark, and/or other laws of the United States and other countries. You acknowledge and agree that the BorregoRentals Platform and BorregoRentals Content, including all associated intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of BorregoRentals and/or its licensors or authorizing third-parties. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the BorregoRentals Platform, BorregoRentals Content or Member Content. All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, and any other source identifiers of BorregoRentals used on or in connection with the BorregoRentals Platform and BorregoRentals Content are trademarks or registered trademarks of BorregoRentals in the United States and abroad. Trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of third parties used on or in connection with the BorregoRentals Platform, BorregoRentals Content, and/or Collective Content are used for identification purposes only and may be the property of their respective owners.</p>
 
<p>5.3 You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, broadcast or otherwise exploit the BorregoRentals Platform or Collective Content, except to the extent you are the legal owner of certain Member Content or as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by BorregoRentals or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.</p>
 
<p>5.4 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, BorregoRentals grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to (i) download and use the Application on your personal device(s); and (ii) access and view any Collective Content made available on or through the BorregoRentals Platform and accessible to you, solely for your personal and non-commercial use.</p>

Unless you provide specific consent, BorregoRentals does not claim any ownership rights in any Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use or exploit your Member Content.</p>
 
<p>5.6 BorregoRentals may offer Hosts the option of having professional photographers take photographs of their Host Services, which are made available by the photographer to Hosts to include in their Listings with or without a watermark or tag bearing the words "BorregoRentals.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("<strong>Verified Images</strong>"). You are responsible for ensuring that your Host Service is accurately represented in the Verified Images and you will stop using the Verified Images on or through the BorregoRentals Platform if they no longer accurately represent your Listing, if you stop hosting the Host Service featured, or if your BorregoRentals Account is terminated or suspended for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that BorregoRentals shall have the right to use any Verified Images in advertising, marketing and/or any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation to you. Where BorregoRentals is not the exclusive owner of Verified Images, by using such Verified Images on or through the BorregoRentals Platform, you grant to BorregoRentals an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual (or for the term of the protection), sub-licensable and transferable license to use such Verified Images for advertising, marketing and/or any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation to you. BorregoRentals in turn grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to use Verified Images outside of the BorregoRentals Platform solely for your personal and non-commercial use.</p>
 
<p>5.7 You are solely responsible for all Member Content that you make available on or through the BorregoRentals Platform. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Member Content that you make available on or through the BorregoRentals Platform or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to BorregoRentals the rights in and to such Member Content, as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the Member Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Member Content or BorregoRentals's use of the Member Content (or any portion thereof) will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
 
<p>5.8 You will not post, upload, publish, submit or transmit any Member Content that: (i) is fraudulent, false, misleading (directly or by omission or failure to update information) or deceptive; (ii) is defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, vulgar or offensive; (iii) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (iv) is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; (v) promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; or (vi) violates BorregoRentals’s <a href="/help/article/546/what-is-BorregoRentals-s-content-policy">Content Policy</a> or any other BorregoRentals policy. BorregoRentals may, without prior notice, remove or disable access to any Member Content that BorregoRentals finds to be in violation of these Terms or BorregoRentals’s then-current <a href="/help/policies">Policies</a> or <a href="/standards">Standards</a>, or otherwise may be harmful or objectionable to BorregoRentals, its Members, third parties, or property.</p>
 
<p>5.9 BorregoRentals respects copyright law and expects its Members to do the same. If you believe that any content on the BorregoRentals Platform infringes copyrights you own, please notify us in accordance with our <a href="/terms/copyright_policy">Copyright Policy</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="service-fees"><a name="sec6"></a> 6. Service Fees</h4>
 
<p>6.1 BorregoRentals may charge fees to Hosts ("<strong>Host Fees</strong>") and/or Guests ("<strong>Guest Fees</strong>") (collectively, "<strong>Service Fees</strong>") in consideration for the use of the BorregoRentals Platform. More information about when Service Fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our <a href="/help/article/1857/what-are-BorregoRentals-service-fees">Service Fees page</a>.</p>
 
<p>6.2 Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed to a Host or Guest prior to publishing or booking a Listing. BorregoRentals reserves the right to change the Service Fees at any time, and we will provide Members adequate notice of any fee changes before they become effective.</p>
 
<p>6.3 You are responsible for paying any Service Fees that you owe to BorregoRentals. The applicable Service Fees are due and payable and collected by BorregoRentals Payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. Except as otherwise provided on the BorregoRentals Platform, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
 
<h4 id="terms-specific-for-hosts"><a name="sec7"></a> 7. Terms specific for Hosts</h4>
 
<h5 id="terms-applicable-to-all-listings">7.1 Terms applicable to all Listings</h5>
 
<p>7.1.1 When creating a Listing through the BorregoRentals Platform you must (i) provide complete and accurate information about your Host Service (such as listing description, location, and calendar availability), (ii) disclose any deficiencies, restrictions (such as house rules) and requirements that apply (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements for an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information requested by BorregoRentals. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) up-to-date at all times.</p>
 
<p>7.1.2 You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“<strong>Listing Fee</strong>”). Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.</p>
 
<p>7.1.3 Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in particular in relation to cancellations, must not conflict with these Terms or the cancellation policy you have selected for your Listing.</p>
 
<p>7.1.4 Pictures, animations or videos (collectively, "<strong>Images</strong>") used in your Listings must accurately reflect the quality and condition of your Host Services. BorregoRentals reserves the right to require that Listings have a minimum number of Images of a certain format, size and resolution.</p>
 
<p>7.1.5 The placement and ranking of Listings in search results on the BorregoRentals Platform may vary and depend on a variety of factors, such as Guest search parameters and preferences, Host requirements, price and calendar availability, number and quality of Images, customer service and cancellation history, Reviews and Ratings, type of Host Service, and/or ease of booking.</p>
 
<p>7.1.6 When you accept or have pre-approved a booking request by a Guest, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with the Guest and are required to provide your Host Service(s) to the Guest as described in your Listing when the booking request is made. You also agree to pay the applicable Host Fee and any applicable Taxes, which will be collected pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>
 
<p>7.1.7 BorregoRentals recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Host Services. Please review any respective insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest has booked for, if applicable) while staying at your Accommodation or participating in your Experience, Event or other Host Service.</p>
 
<h5 id="listing-accommodations">7.2 Listing Accommodations</h5>
 
<p>7.2.1 You may only list one Accommodation per Listing.</p>
 
<p>7.2.2 If you choose to require a security deposit for your Accommodation, you must specify this in your Listing ("<strong>Security Deposit</strong>"). Hosts are not allowed to ask for a Security Deposit after a booking has been confirmed or outside of the BorregoRentals Platform. BorregoRentals will use commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but BorregoRentals is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits.</p>
 
<p>7.2.3 You represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation will (i) not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, or other agreements, and (ii) comply with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, and other rules and regulations (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations). As a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).</p>
 
<h5 id="listing-experiences-events-and-other-host-services">7.3 Listing Experiences, Events and other Host Services</h5>
 
<p>7.3.1 To list an Experience, Event or other Host Service, you must create a Listing and submit the Experience, Event or Host Service to BorregoRentals. To be considered for publishing on the BorregoRentals Platform, Experiences, Events or other Host Services must at all times meet the <a href="/help/topic/906/">quality standards for Experiences</a> and meet Guest demand. BorregoRentals reserves the right to decide, in its sole discretion, if a submitted Experience, Event or other Host Service will be published on the BorregoRentals Platform.</p>
 
<p>7.3.2 When listing an Experience, Event or other Host Service you must, where applicable, fully educate and inform Guests about (i) any risks inherent to the Experience, Event or other Host Service, (ii) any requirements for participation, such as the minimum age, related skills, level of fitness or other requirements, and (iii) anything else they may need to know to safely participate in the Experience, Event or other Host Service (including dress codes, equipment, special certifications or licenses, etc.).</p>
 
<p>7.3.3 If you wish to list an Experience on behalf of a Nonprofit (“Social Impact Experience”), you must comply with the <a href="/help/article/1578">eligibility requirements</a> for hosting a Social Impact Experience. When listing a Social Impact Experience you (i) represent and warrant that you are duly authorized to act on behalf of your Nonprofit and (ii) acknowledge and agree that all payouts will be directed to an account owned by your Nonprofit. You and your Nonprofit acknowledge that listing a Social Impact Experience does not create a commercial fundraising or co-venturer, or charitable trust relationship with BorregoRentals and BorregoRentals is not a professional fundraiser or commercial participator. Nonprofits, and not BorregoRentals, are responsible for determining what, if any, portion of their Listing Fee is a charitable contribution and for providing Guests charitable tax receipts for any applicable charitable contributions. You and your Nonprofit are solely responsible for complying with all laws that apply to your organization and your Social Impact Experience.</p>
 
<p>7.3.4 You represent and warrant that you (i) understand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that may apply to your Experience, Event or other Host Service(s), and (ii) will obtain any required licenses, permits, or registrations prior to providing your Experience, Event or other Host Service(s). You can find additional information about some of the legal obligations that may apply to you on our <a href="/help/topic/896/responsible-hosting">Responsible Hosting</a> pages.</p>
 
<p>7.3.5 You must provide an Experience, Event or other Host Service in person and may not allow any third party to provide the Experience, Event or other Host Service on your behalf, unless authorized by BorregoRentals.</p>
 
<h5 id="co-hosts">7.4 Co-Hosts</h5>
 
<p>7.4.1 BorregoRentals may enable Hosts to authorize other Members (“<strong>Co-Hosts</strong>”) to administer the Host’s Listing(s), and to bind the Host and take certain actions in relation to the Listing(s) as permitted by the Host, such as accepting booking requests, messaging and welcoming Guests, and updating the Listing Fee and calendar availability (collectively, “<strong>Co-Host Services</strong>”). Any agreement formed between Host and Co-Host may not conflict with these Terms and the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. Co-Hosts may only act in an individual capacity and not on behalf of a company or other organization, unless expressly authorized by BorregoRentals. BorregoRentals reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the number of Co-Hosts a Host may invite for each Listing and to limit the number of Listings a Co-Host may manage.</p>
 
<p>7.4.2 Hosts and Co-Hosts may agree on a fee (“<strong>Co-Host Services Fee</strong>”) in consideration for the Co-Host Services provided by the Co-Host. When such an agreement is made, the Host agrees to pay the Co-Host Services Fee for any confirmed booking of their Listing, which will be deducted directly from the Listing Fee after deduction of any applicable Host Fee. In addition, Hosts may instruct a Co-Host to provide certain one-time services in relation to their Listing. Hosts can pay Co-Hosts for one-time services and any other expenses using the Resolution Center. BorregoRentals Payments will process Co-Host Services Fees and Resolution Center payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>
 
<p>7.4.3 Hosts and Co-Hosts agree that each activity, booking, or other transaction reported on the BorregoRentals Platform, including any Co-Host Services provided by the Co-Host and any amounts due from a Host to the Co-Host for the provision of such services, will be deemed accurate, correct and binding, unless challenged, by notifying the other person and BorregoRentals (by emailing <a href="mailto:host-exp@BorregoRentals.com">host-exp@BorregoRentals.com</a>), within 21 days of posting of the disputed activity, booking or other transaction on the BorregoRentals Platform.</p>
 
<p>7.4.4 Hosts should exercise due diligence and care when deciding who to add as a Co-Host to their Listing(s). Hosts remain solely responsible and liable for any and all Listings and Member Content published on the BorregoRentals Platform, including any Listing created by a Co-Host on their behalf. Further, Hosts remain responsible and liable for their own acts and omissions, including, but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage to the Co-Host(s). Co-Hosts remain responsible and liable for their own acts and omissions when engaging in their roles and responsibilities as a Co-Host, including, but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage to the Host. In addition, both Host and Co-Host are jointly responsible and severally liable for third party claims, including Guest claims, arising from the acts and omissions of the other person as related to hosting activities, communications with Guests, and the provision of any Co-Host Services.</p>
 
<p>7.4.5 Unless agreed otherwise by Host and Co-Host, Host and Co-Host may terminate the Co-Host agreement at any time. In addition, both Host and Co-Host acknowledge that their Co-hosting relationship will terminate in the event that BorregoRentals (i) terminates the Co-Host service or (ii) terminates either party’s participation in the Co-Host service. When the Co-Host agreement is terminated, the Host will remain responsible for all of the Co-Host’s actions prior to the termination, including the responsibility to fulfill any pending or future bookings initiated prior to the termination. When a Member is removed as a Co-Host, that Member will no longer have access to any Host or Guest information related to the applicable Host’s Listing(s). In addition, Host agrees to pay Co-Host for all Co-Host Services completed prior to Co-Host’s termination within 14 days of Co-Host’s termination via the Resolution Center. A Co-Host will not be entitled to any fees for any Co-Host Services that have not been completed prior to the Co-Host’s termination.</p>
 
<p>7.4.6 As a Co-Host, you will not be reviewed by Guests, meaning that your Co-Host activities will not affect your Reviews or Ratings for other Listings for which you are a Host. Instead, the Host of such Listing(s) will be reviewed by Guests (including potentially on the basis of the Co-Host’s conduct and performance). Hosts acknowledge that Reviews and Ratings from Guests for their Listing(s) may be impacted by a Co-Host’s conduct and performance.</p>
 
<h4 id="terms-specific-for-guests"><a name="sec8"></a> 8. Terms specific for Guests</h4>
 
<h5 id="terms-applicable-to-all-bookings">8.1 Terms applicable to all bookings</h5>
 
<p>8.1.1 Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any verification processes) set by the Host, you can book a Listing available on the BorregoRentals Platform by following the respective booking process. All applicable fees, including the Listing Fee, Security Deposit (if applicable), Guest Fee and any applicable Taxes (collectively, “<strong>Total Fees</strong>”) will be presented to you prior to booking a Listing. You agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your BorregoRentals Account.</p>
 
<p>8.1.2 Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from BorregoRentals, a legally binding agreement is formed between you and your Host, subject to any additional terms and conditions of the Host that apply, including in particular the applicable cancellation policy and any rules and restrictions specified in the Listing. BorregoRentals Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of the booking request or upon the Host’s confirmation pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>
 
<p>8.1.3 If you book a Host Service on behalf of additional guests, you are required to ensure that every additional guest meets any requirements set by the Host, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and restrictions set by the Host. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor, you represent and warrant that you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors may only participate in an Experience, Event or other Host Service if accompanied by an adult who is responsible for them.</p>
 
<h5 id="booking-accommodations">8.2 Booking Accommodations</h5>
 
<p>8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation (“<strong>Accommodation Booking</strong>”) is a limited license granted to you by the Host to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which time the Host (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in accordance with your agreement with the Host.</p>
 
<p>8.2.2 You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Host. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host's consent (“<strong>Overstay</strong>”), you no longer have a license to stay in the Accommodation and the Host is entitled to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if requested by the Host, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Guest Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make you leave (collectively, "<strong>Overstay Fees</strong>"). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Host as a result of such Overstay. BorregoRentals Payments will collect Overstay Fees from you pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. A Security Deposit, if required by a Host, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Guest’s Overstay.</p>
 
<h5 id="booking-experiences-events-and-other-host-services">8.3 Booking Experiences, Events and other Host Services</h5>
 
<p>8.3.1 You should carefully review the description of any Experience, Event or other Host Service you intend to book to ensure you (and any additional guests you are booking for) meet any minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements which the Host has specified in their Listing. You are required to inform the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your and any additional guest’s ability to safely participate in any Experience, Event or other Host Service. In addition, certain laws, like the minimum legal drinking age in the location of the Experience, Event or other Host Service, may also apply. You are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your participation in an Experience, Event or other Host Service.</p>
 
<p>8.3.2 Before and during an Experience, Event or other Host Service you must at all times adhere to the Hosts’ instructions.</p>
 
<p>8.3.3 You may not bring any additional individuals to an Experience, Event or other Host Service unless such an individual was added by you as an additional guest during the booking process on the BorregoRentals Platform.</p>

<p>9.2 Guests can cancel a confirmed booking at any time subject to the Listing’s cancellation policy, and BorregoRentals Payments will provide any refund to the Guest in accordance with such cancellation policy.

<p>9.3 If a Host cancels a confirmed booking, the Guest will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking and BorregoRentals may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Host indicating that a booking was cancelled. In addition, BorregoRentals may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, and/or (ii) impose a cancellation fee, unless the Host has a valid reason for cancelling the booking pursuant to <a href="/help/article/1320/what-is-BorregoRentals-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy">BorregoRentals’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy</a> or has legitimate concerns about the Guest’s behavior.</p>
 
<p>9.4 For Experiences, Events and other Host Services, if inclement weather creates an unsafe or uncomfortable scenario for Guests, Hosts may modify or cancel a Host Service. If there is a substantial change in the itinerary or the Host Service needs to be cancelled, BorregoRentals will work with the Host to provide Guests an alternative date for the Host Service, an appropriate refund or a rebooking.</p>
 
<p>9.5 In certain circumstances, BorregoRentals may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking and make appropriate refund and payout decisions. This may be for reasons set forth in <a href="/help/article/1320/what-is-BorregoRentals-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy">BorregoRentals's Extenuating Circumstances Policy</a> or (i) where BorregoRentals believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this is necessary to avoid significant harm to BorregoRentals, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons set out in these Terms.</p>
 
<p>9.6 If a Guest suffers a Travel Issue pursuant to the <a href="/terms/guest_refund_policy">Guest Refund Policy</a>, BorregoRentals may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Guest part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy.</p>
 
<p>9.7 Members may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, additional Host Services, Co-Host Services or Damage Claims related to bookings.

<h4 id="ratings-and-reviews"><a name="sec10"></a> 10. Ratings and Reviews</h4>
 
<p>10.1 Within a certain timeframe after completing a booking, Guests and Hosts can leave a public review (“<strong>Review</strong>”) and submit a star rating (“<strong>Rating</strong>”) about each other. Any Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinion of individual Members and do not reflect the opinion of BorregoRentals. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by BorregoRentals for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.</p>
 
<p>10.2 Ratings and Reviews by Guests and Hosts must be fair, truthful and factual and may not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews must comply with BorregoRentals’s <a href="/help/article/546/what-is-BorregoRentals-s-content-policy">Content Policy</a> and <a href="/help/article/548/what-is-BorregoRentals-s-extortion-policy">Extortion Policy</a>.</p>
 
<p>10.3 Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party write a positive or negative Review about another Member.</p>
 
<h4 id="damage-to-accommodations-disputes-between-members"><a name="sec11"></a> 11. Damage to Accommodations, Disputes between Members</h4>
 
<p>11.1 As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at the Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation, excluding the Host (and the individuals the Host invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).</p>
 
<p>11.2 If a Host claims and provides evidence that you as a Guest have damaged an Accommodation or any personal or other property at an Accommodation ("<strong>Damage Claim</strong>"), the Host can seek payment from you through the Resolution Center. If a Host escalates a Damage Claim to BorregoRentals, you will be given an opportunity to respond. If you agree to pay the Host, or BorregoRentals determines in its sole discretion that you are responsible for the Damage Claim, BorregoRentals Payments will collect any such sums from you and/or against the Security Deposit (if applicable) required to cover the Damage Claim pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. BorregoRentals also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to BorregoRentals in this regard in situations in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the BorregoRentals Host Guarantee.</p>
 
<p>11.3 Members agree to cooperate with and assist BorregoRentals in good faith, and to provide BorregoRentals with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by BorregoRentals, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the BorregoRentals Host Guarantee), Experiences, or Co-Host agreements. A Member shall, upon BorregoRentals's reasonable request and at no cost to the Member, participate in mediation or a similar resolution process with another Member, which process will be conducted by BorregoRentals or a third party selected by BorregoRentals or its insurer, with respect to losses for which a Member is requesting payment from BorregoRentals (including but not limited to payments under the BorregoRentals Host Guarantee).</p>
 
<p>11.4 If you are a Guest or a Co-Host, you understand and agree that BorregoRentals may make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused, or been responsible for, to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by BorregoRentals under the BorregoRentals Host Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist BorregoRentals in good faith, and to provide BorregoRentals with such information as may be reasonably requested by BorregoRentals, to make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as BorregoRentals may reasonably request to assist BorregoRentals in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>
 
<h4 id="rounding-off-currency-conversion"><a name="sec12"></a> 12. Rounding off, Currency conversion</h4>
 
<p>12.1 BorregoRentals may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, BorregoRentals will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of $101.49 to $101.00. For currencies that are denominated in large numbers, BorregoRentals may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; for example, BorregoRentals may round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>
 
<p>12.2 The BorregoRentals Platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Hosts who may prefer to pay in a currency different from their destination currency, which may require currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the BorregoRentals Platform allows Members to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for Members to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location. Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="taxes"><a name="sec13"></a> 13. Taxes</h4>
 
<p>13.1 As a Host you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income taxes ("<strong>Taxes</strong>").</p>
 
<p>13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Hosts, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. If a Host fails to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to freeze all payouts, withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both, until resolution.</p>
 
<p>13.3 You understand that any appropriate governmental agency, department and/or authority ("<strong>Tax Authority</strong>") where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts on Listing Fees, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "transient occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes," "lodging taxes," "city taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" ("<strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>").</p>
 
<p>13.4 In certain jurisdictions, BorregoRentals may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance these Terms ("<strong>Collection and Remittance</strong>") if such jurisdiction asserts BorregoRentals or Hosts have an Occupancy Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby instruct and authorize BorregoRentals (via BorregoRentals Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Host's behalf at the time Listing Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by BorregoRentals will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where BorregoRentals is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Hosts are not permitted to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by BorregoRentals relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.</p>
 
<p>13.5 You agree that any claim or cause of action relating to BorregoRentals's facilitation of Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by BorregoRentals in connection with facilitation of Collection and Remittance, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by BorregoRentals from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>
 
<p>13.6 BorregoRentals reserves the right, with prior notice to Hosts, to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction for any reason at which point Hosts and Guests are once again solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that jurisdiction.</p>

Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Hosts pursuant to these Terms or an approved payment request under the BorregoRentals Host Guarantee, in no event will BorregoRentals’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the BorregoRentals Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via the BorregoRentals Platform, or from the use of or inability to use the BorregoRentals Platform or Collective Content and in connection with any Accommodation, Experiences, Event or other Host Service, or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the BorregoRentals Platform as a Guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a Host, the amounts paid by BorregoRentals to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between BorregoRentals and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect BorregoRentals’s liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation, misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>17.2 If you reside in the EU, BorregoRentals is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. BorregoRentals is liable for any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are such duties of BorregoRentals in whose proper fulfilment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract but the amount shall be limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damage. Any additional liability of BorregoRentals is excluded.</strong></p>
 
<h4 id="indemnification"><a name="sec18"></a> 18. Indemnification</h4>
 
<p>You agree to release, defend (at BorregoRentals’s option), indemnify, and hold BorregoRentals and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the BorregoRentals Platform or any BorregoRentals Services, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience, Event or other Host Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, (iv) BorregoRentals’s Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights.</p>
 
<h4 id="dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement"><a name="sec19"></a> 19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h4>
 
<p>19.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not reside in the United States, but bring any claim against BorregoRentals in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 21).</p>
 
<p>19.2 <em>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. BorregoRentals is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with BorregoRentals’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 19). Specifically, the process provides:</p>
 
<ul><li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>);</li><li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li><li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li><li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li><li>The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li><li>The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li><li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</li></ul>
 
<p>19.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and BorregoRentals each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact BorregoRentals’s customer service team by <a href="mailto:terms@BorregoRentals.com">emailing us</a>. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>
 
<p><strong>19.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and BorregoRentals mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the BorregoRentals Platform, the Host Services, or the Collective Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and BorregoRentals agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>
 
<p>19.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and BorregoRentals each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>
 
<p>19.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</p>
 
<p>19.7 <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, BorregoRentals agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and BorregoRentals both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>
 
<p>19.8 <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, BorregoRentals agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
 
<p>19.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>
 
<p><strong>19.10 <em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and BorregoRentals acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>19.11 <em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and BorregoRentals acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and BorregoRentals both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>
 
<p>19.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>
 
<p>19.13 <em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of these Terms”), if BorregoRentals changes this Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of BorregoRentals’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and BorregoRentals in accordance with the provisions of the “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
 
<p>19.14 <em>Survival</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.12 and subject to Section 15.8, this Section 19 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the BorregoRentals Platform or terminate your BorregoRentals Account.</p>
 
<h4 id="feedback"><a name="sec20"></a> 20. Feedback</h4>
 
<p>We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the BorregoRentals Platform (“<strong>Feedback</strong>“). You may submit Feedback by emailing us, through the <a href="/help/contact_us">“Contact”</a> section of the BorregoRentals Platform, or by other means of communication.

By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.</p>
 
<h4 id="applicable-law-and-jurisdiction"><a name="sec21"></a> 21. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
 
<p>21.1 If you reside in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 19 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</p>
 
<p>21.2 If you reside in China these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of China (“<strong>China Laws</strong>”). Any dispute arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) for arbitration in Beijing which shall be conducted in accordance with CIETAC’s arbitration rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration, provided that this section shall not be construed to limit any rights which BorregoRentals may have to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring you to perform or be prohibited from performing certain acts and other provisional relief permitted under China Laws or any other laws that may apply to you. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award rendered is final and binding upon both parties.</p>
 
<p>21.3 If you reside outside of the United States and China, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with Irish law. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded. The choice of law does not impact your rights as a consumer according to the consumer protection regulations of your country of residence. If you are acting as a consumer, you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts. Judicial proceedings that you are able to bring against us arising from or in connection with these Terms may only be brought in a court located in Ireland or a court with jurisdiction in your place of residence. If BorregoRentals wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.</p>
 
<h4 id="general-provisions"><a name="sec22"></a> 22. General Provisions</h4>
 
<p>22.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines or standards, these Terms constitute the entire Agreement between BorregoRentals and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between BorregoRentals and you in relation to the access to and use of the BorregoRentals Platform.</p>
 
<p>22.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and BorregoRentals as a result of this Agreement or your use of the BorregoRentals Platform.</p>
 
<p>22.3 These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.</p>
 
<p>22.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
 
<p>22.5 BorregoRentals’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.</p>
 
<p>22.6 You may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without BorregoRentals's prior written consent. BorregoRentals may without restriction assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.</p>
 
<p>22.7 Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications to Members permitted or required under this Agreement, will be in writing and given by BorregoRentals via email, BorregoRentals Platform notification, or messaging service (including SMS and WeChat). For notices made to Members residing outside of Germany, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which BorregoRentals transmits the notice.</p>
 
<p>22.8 If you reside in the EU you can access the European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" class="uri">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.
